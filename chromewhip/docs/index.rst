Chromewhip - Google Chromeâ„¢ as a web service
============================================

Chromewhip is an easily deployable service that runs headless Chrome process
wrapped with an HTTP API. Inspired by the [`splash`](https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash)
project, we aim to provide a drop-in replacement for the `splash` service by adhering to their documented API.
